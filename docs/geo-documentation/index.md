# XbimGeometry

XbimGeometry is part of the [Xbim Toolkit](https://github.com/xBimTeam). 

It contains the the Geometry Engine and Scene processing, which provide geometric and topological operations 
to enable users to visualise models in 3D models, typically as a Tesselated scene or mesh.

The native Geometry Engine is built around the open source [Open Cascade 7.3 library](https://www.opencascade.com/content/overview)
which performs much of the boolean operations involve in generating 3D solids.
